The News plugin allows to make news postings or announcements either site-wide or group-specific. This News plugin is very similar to the Blog plugin bundled with Elgg core (actually it's based on it). Therefore, the posting of news works still quite in the same way as posting a blog but the news will be displayed separately from the blogs postings to indicate that they are kind of different (meant as news or site announcement and not as a blog posting only). Additionally, the difference is that only admins and group owners can make news postings. Group owners can only make news postings within a group they own while admins can post a news both within groups and side-wide.

The News plugin also contains an index page News widget and a News widget for group pages, if you (optionally) use the Widget Manager plugin.

This News plugin might also be able to replace other former News plugins as long as they were also based on the Blog plugin, use the subtype "news" for the news objects (and have not been modified regarding the data structure of the news objects).


Installation:
